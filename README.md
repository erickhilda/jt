- Fetch Jira tickets as markdown with full ADF-to-markdown conversion
- Preserves a local "My Notes" section across re-pulls
- Dry-run and comments-only update modes
- Open tickets in your browser directly from the terminal
- Print file paths for easy piping to other tools
- Fetch Bitbucket Cloud pull requests (diff + comments) as markdown for code-review context
- Fetch Confluence Cloud pages as markdown (ADF-to-markdown) for offline reading and LLM context

Requires Go 1.25+.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Configure your Jira instance, email, and API token
jt init

# 2. Pull a ticket to local markdown
jt pull PROJ-123

# 3. View it
jt view PROJ-123

# 4. Open in browser
jt open PROJ-123
```

## Creating a Jira API Token

jt authenticates using Jira Cloud API tokens (not your account password). To create one:

1. Log in to <https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens>
2. Click **Create API token**
3. Give it a label (e.g. "jt CLI") and click **Create**
4. Copy the token -- you won't be able to see it again

Paste the token when `jt init` prompts for it. The token inherits the permissions of your Atlassian account.

If you need to rotate a token later, create a new one in the same page and update jt:

```bash
jt config set token <new-token>
```

## Commands

### `jt init`

Interactive setup wizard. Prompts for your Jira instance URL, email, API token, and default project key. Tests credentials before saving.

### `jt auth test`

Verify stored credentials against the Jira API. Prints your display name, email, account ID, and timezone on success.

### `jt auth bitbucket`

Set (and verify) a Bitbucket Cloud API token, stored separately from the Jira token. Create the token at <https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens> with scopes `read:pullrequest:bitbucket` and `read:repository:bitbucket`. If `bitbucket_workspace` is configured, the token is verified against it.

### `jt config show`

Display all configuration settings (token is masked).

### `jt config set <key> <value>`

Update a single configuration value.

Valid keys: `instance`, `email`, `default_project`, `tickets_dir`, `fetch_comments`, `token`, `bitbucket_workspace`, `prs_dir`, `bitbucket_token`.

```bash
jt config set instance https://myorg.atlassian.net
jt config set default_project PROJ
jt config set fetch_comments false
```

### `jt pull <TICKET-KEY>`

Fetch a Jira ticket and save it as local markdown.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--comments-only` | Only update the comments section |
| `--dry-run` | Show a diff of what would change without saving |

The pull command preserves any content you've written under the `## My Notes` section.

### `jt view <TICKET-KEY>`

Print the local ticket markdown to stdout. Useful for piping:

```bash
jt view PROJ-123 | less
```

### `jt open <TICKET-KEY>`

Open the ticket in your default browser.

### `jt path <TICKET-KEY>`

Print the absolute filesystem path to a ticket's markdown file. Useful for scripting:

```bash
cat "$(jt path PROJ-123)"
```

### `jt pr <PR-REF>`

Fetch a Bitbucket Cloud pull request (metadata, diff, comments) and save it as local markdown for code-review context. Requires a Bitbucket token (`jt auth bitbucket`).

Reference forms:

```bash
jt pr 4521                    # infer workspace/repo from the git remote (run inside the repo)
jt pr widget/4521             # repo explicit, workspace from `bitbucket_workspace`
jt pr acme/widget/4521        # fully explicit
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--no-diff` | Omit the unified diff (keep diffstat + comments) — useful for very large PRs |
| `--dry-run` | Show a diff of what would change without saving |

PRs are saved to `prs_dir` (default `~/.jt/prs`) as `<workspace>__<repo>__<id>.md`. A `## My Notes` section is preserved across re-fetches, and if the PR's branch/title contains a Jira key (e.g. `PROJ-1234`) it is linked — with a pointer to the local ticket file when one exists.

The full unified diff is embedded by default; on a large diff `jt pr` prints a warning (it never silently truncates) so you can re-run with `--no-diff`.

### `jt page <PAGE-ID | URL>`

Fetch a Confluence Cloud page (title, metadata, body) and save it as local markdown for offline reading and LLM context. The page body is converted from Atlassian Document Format to markdown using the same converter as `jt pull`.

This reuses your existing Jira API token — Confluence lives on the same Atlassian site (`<instance>/wiki`) and uses the same authentication, so no separate login is needed as long as the token has Confluence access (unscoped API tokens do; a scoped token needs a Confluence read scope).

Reference forms:

```bash
jt page 12345                                                       # numeric page ID
jt page https://acme.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/12345/Title   # full page URL
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--dry-run` | Show a diff of what would change without saving |

Pages are saved to `pages_dir` (default `~/.jt/pages`) as `<space>__<id>__<slug>.md`. A `## My Notes` section is preserved across re-fetches.

## Configuration

Configuration is stored in `~/.jt/config.yaml`:

```yaml
instance: https://yourcompany.atlassian.net
email: you@company.com
default_project: PROJ
tickets_dir: ~/.jt/tickets
token_storage: keyring
fetch_comments: true
```

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `instance` | Jira Cloud base URL (must start with `https://`) |
| `email` | Jira account email |
| `default_project` | Default project key (optional) |
| `tickets_dir` | Directory for saved tickets (default: `~/.jt/tickets`) |
| `token_storage` | `keyring` (system keyring) or `file` (`~/.jt/credentials`, 0600) |
| `fetch_comments` | Fetch and render the Comments section. Default `true`. Set `false` to skip comments on `pull`, `diff`, and `sync` (smaller payloads; existing `## Comments` blocks in local files are preserved). `jt pull --comments-only` overrides this and always refreshes comments. |
| `bitbucket_workspace` | Default Bitbucket workspace for `jt pr <repo>/<id>` references |
| `prs_dir` | Directory for saved pull requests (default: `~/.jt/prs`) |
| `pages_dir` | Directory for saved Confluence pages (default: `~/.jt/pages`) |

API tokens are stored in your system keyring when available, with an automatic fallback to an encrypted credentials file.

## Local File Format

Pulled tickets are saved as `~/.jt/tickets/<KEY>.md`:

```markdown
<!-- jt:meta ticket=PROJ-123 fetched=2026-02-14T10:30:00Z -->
